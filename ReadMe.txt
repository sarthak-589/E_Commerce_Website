explain of code that how to upload image at admin panel.


list_display = ['id', 'title', 'display_category_image']: This attribute specifies the fields that should be displayed in the list view of the admin interface for Category instances. It includes the id, title, and display_category_image fields.


def display_category_image(self, obj): This is a custom method defined within the CategoryAdmin class. It takes two parameters: self, which refers to the instance of the CategoryAdmin class, and obj, which refers to an individual Category instance being displayed in the admin interface.

if obj.category_image:: This condition checks if the Category instance (obj) has a non-empty category_image field. It's assuming that the Category model has a field named category_image, presumably a ImageField or similar.

return mark_safe('<img src="{}" width="50px" height="50px" />'.format(obj.category_image.url)): If the Category instance has a category_image, this line constructs an HTML <img> tag with the src attribute set to the URL of the category image. It uses Django's mark_safe function to mark the HTML string as safe for rendering, to avoid HTML escaping. The image is resized to 50x50 pixels using the width and height attributes.

return None: If the Category instance does not have a category_image (i.e., if the condition in step 5 is not met), this line returns None.

display_category_image.short_description = 'Category Image': This line sets the short_description attribute of the display_category_image method. This is used to specify the header for the image column in the admin interface. It's just a descriptive text that will be displayed to the user.
